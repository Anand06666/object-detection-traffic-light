# object-detection-traffic-light
This project implements a real-time AI-based traffic signal controller using YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) and OpenCV. It detects people and vehicles from a webcam feed and automatically switches the traffic light between RED and GREEN based on the number of detected objects.
